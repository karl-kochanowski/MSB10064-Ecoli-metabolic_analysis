- Matlab scripts to reproduce constrained flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis
- Tested in Win 10 64x machine with: Matlab 2019A, Gurobi V9.0.2, Cobra toolbox 3.0 (accessed on December 18th 2020)

Software needed to run the code:
- Matlab (at least 2019A)
- Gurobi (tested with Gurobi V9.0.2, free academic licences available at https://www.gurobi.com/ )
- Cobra toolbox 3.0 (https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/ )

How-to:
run "main_analysis_gsFBA" to perform FBA, FVA, and performed quality control analyses
NOTE: FVA takes a long time (>1h)

For reference, the analysis output is included in the \Data subfolder as "20210112_analysis_output.mat"
- FBA flux estimates for catabolic and anabolic limitations (in total: 16 conditions) are found in output.FBA.flux
- corresponding minimal/maximal FVA ranges are found in output.FBA.minFVA and output.FBA.maxFVA
- the modified (but unconstrained) FBA model is found in output.model
- the 16 modified and constrained FBA models (one per condition, constrained by physiology) are found in output.FBA.model
