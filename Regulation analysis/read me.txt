- Matlab scripts to reproduce regulation analysis
- Tested in Win 10 64x machine with: Matlab 2019A

Software needed to run the code:
- Matlab (at least 2019A)


How-to:
run "main_regulation_analysis" to perform all analysis steps and reproduce all related figures

For reference, the analysis output is included in the \Data subfolder as "20210126_analysis_output.mat"
- results of regulation analysis relating flux and protein changes are found in the data structure data.regulationAnalysis.fluxVSprotein
- results of regulation analysis also considering substrates are found in the data structure data.regulationAnalysis.enzymeSaturation
- in each data structure, the tables labeled "export" correspond to the data in EV table 5 of the manuscript
